# issues

A CLI tool for managing Jira tickets on Liferay's Atlassian instance. Create, view, update, transition, and search issues without leaving the terminal.

## Install

### Homebrew

```sh
brew tap dtruong/tap
brew install issues
```

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/david-truong/liferay-issues-cli.git
cd liferay-issues-cli
make install
```

### Download binary

Grab the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/david-truong/liferay-issues-cli/releases) for your platform.

## Authentication

Configure credentials using one of these methods (checked in order):

### 1. Environment variables

```sh
export JIRA_USER="you@liferay.com"
export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
```

### 2. Config file

```sh
issues config set auth.email you@liferay.com
issues config set auth.token your-api-token
```

### 3. .netrc (legacy)

If you already have a `~/.netrc` entry for Liferay Jira, it works automatically:

```
machine liferay.atlassian.net
login you@liferay.com
password your-api-token
```

Generate an API token at https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens.
